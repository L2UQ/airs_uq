Supporting software for simulation based uncertainty quantification for the AIRS Level 2 algorithm

The AIRS Monte Carlo simulation experiments are carried out in several steps. Supporting software is 
linked where available. Simulations are defined for a *geophysical template*, a specific set of atmospheric and
observing conditions. For AIRS, a template is typically referenced by dates/season, region of interest, and 
time of day.
